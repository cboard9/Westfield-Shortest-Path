Westfield State Campus Navigator

Description:
This program allows users to find the shortest path between different locations on the Westfield State University campus. 
It utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path based on distances between different points on the campus.

The Westfield State Campus (as a graph) is available to view what two points you want to get between.

Usage:
1.	Compile and run the Main.java file.
2.	Follow the prompts to enter the starting and ending destinations by providing the corresponding letters (A-Z) of the locations on the campus.
3.	The program will then display the shortest path between the specified locations along with the total distance in meters.
4.	You can choose to exit the program or continue finding paths by entering 0 to exit or 1 to continue.

Instructions:
•	When prompted for the starting and ending destinations, enter the letters (A-Z) corresponding to the locations on the Westfield State campus.

•	If the provided letters are not valid or do not represent locations on the campus, the program will prompt you to enter them again.

•	After displaying the shortest path and total distance, you can choose to exit the program or continue finding paths.

Dependencies:
•	Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher

•	Java Standard Library
